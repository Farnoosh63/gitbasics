## Description

This is the beginning of learning to work with **version control system**. Epicodus students use the most popular toolbelt VCS, **Git**.

## Setup:

First we create a new directory using commands in Terminal.Next step was initiating a git repository inside the directory. Theen by _touch_ command we created File1. The file is added to the staging area and all the changes are tracked by git repository.
Additional step is pushing the repository to our new remote repository in github account.
